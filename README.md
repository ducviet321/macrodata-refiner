Fan-made game from the series Serverance on AppleTV. The project was made in Godot 4.4 during weekend after I watched the season 2. Below is the "Instructions" in Lumon wording style.



## Macrodata Refinement Training - Orientation Guide

**Welcome, Refiner.**

Your duty is clear: **Sort. Refine. Achieve.**

---

### Controls

- **Hold Left Mouse Button** to select numbers, then tap on a folder to sort.  
- **Hold Right Mouse Button** to navigate your workspace.

---

### Refinement Rules

- You must select a group of **at least three numbers** within the **same temper**.  
- Isolated numbers are meaningless. **Order brings purpose.**

---

### Objective

The numbers before you are not random.  
They hold secrets.  

**Meet your quota. Do not question the work. Simply refine.**

**Praise Kier.**
